# To Do App Exercise

Please complete the exercise by implementing a complete set of playwright tests for the To-Do Application.

The To-Do Application maintains a list of items you may want to complete later. You can add items, remove items, mark items as completed, and filter the items.

## Getting started

This all requires node. Once installed it can be tested using the following commands.

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
npx playwright test
```

### Run the Playwright UI

The playwright UI can be started with the following command.

```bash
npm test
```

### Start the To Do App

The To Do app can be started independently using the command:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npx http-server -o
```
